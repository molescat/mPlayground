/*
Classes have additional capabilities that structures do not:

* Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
* Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.
* Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.
* Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.
